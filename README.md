# THE PARADOX OF NCR: HIGH FISCAL CAPACITY, SUB-OPTIMAL UTILIZATION

## Overview

The National Capital Region (NCR) is the largest metropolitan area in the Philippines. Highly urbanized and home to the country's major economic hubs, NCR cities provide the largest range of services and have the capacity to produce more local revenues than any part of the country. Data shows that the overall IRA dependency of NCR cities is significantly lower (20-30%) than that of the Provinces and non-NCR cities and municipalities (70-80%), mainly due to the larger percentage of internally sourced revenues of NCR cities, including business taxes (BT) and Real Property Tax (RPT). However, despite possessing substantial financial resources and low dependence on national funds, NCR cities face the challenge of sub-optimal utilization, leading to significant levels of excess income. Based on data from the Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF), NCR cities consistently recorded an operating income that was higher than their operating expenditures. This paradox poses a problem:  underutilization highlights the increasing trend in excess income, which is not being channeled into essential public services. While NCR cities have successfully reduced their dependence on IRA, they now confront the equally critical task of enhancing their absorptive capacity—the ability to efficiently plan, execute, and account for projects that translate available funds into public goods and services.

## Policy Overview
The context of this policy analysis is rooted in the assessment of NCR's decentralization and the ability of NCR cities to provide efficient and quality services anchored in accountability. The underutilization of programmed budgets despite the high fiscal capacity of NCR cities is a highly relevant issue aligned with the recent calls for systemic accountability and the efficient delivery of public goods and services. It also highlights the risks of high discretionary power and monopolizing capacity attributed to the Local Chief Executive (LEC). Effective accountability mechanisms must be in place to guide the utilization of programmed budgets and ensure the optimal use and delivery of public goods and services.
