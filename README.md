# THE PARADOX OF NCR: HIGH FISCAL CAPACITY, SUB-OPTIMAL UTILIZATION

## Overview

The National Capital Region (NCR) is the largest metropolitan area in the Philippines. Highly urbanized and home to the country's major economic hubs, NCR cities provide the largest range of services and have the capacity to produce more local revenues than any part of the country. Data shows that the overall IRA dependency of NCR cities is significantly lower (20-30%) than that of the Provinces and non-NCR cities and municipalities (70-80%), mainly due to the larger percentage of internally sourced revenues of NCR cities, including business taxes (BT) and Real Property Tax (RPT). However, despite possessing substantial financial resources and low dependence on national funds, NCR cities face the challenge of sub-optimal utilization, leading to significant levels of excess income. Based on data from the Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF), NCR cities consistently recorded an operating income that was higher than their operating expenditures. This paradox poses a problem:  underutilization highlights the increasing trend in excess income, which is not being channeled into essential public services. While NCR cities have successfully reduced their dependence on IRA, they now confront the equally critical task of enhancing their absorptive capacity—the ability to efficiently plan, execute, and account for projects that translate available funds into public goods and services.

## Policy Overview
The context of this policy analysis is rooted in the assessment of NCR's decentralization and the ability of NCR cities to provide efficient and quality services anchored in accountability. The underutilization of programmed budgets despite the high fiscal capacity of NCR cities is a highly relevant issue aligned with the recent calls for systemic accountability. It also highlights the risks of high discretionary power and monopolizing capacity attributed to the Local Chief Executive (LEC). Effective accountability mechanisms must be in place to guide the utilization of programmed budgets and ensure the optimal use and delivery of public goods and services.

## Insights and Analyses
The fiscal paradox of NCR cities raises questions about accountability and institutional capacity. This paradox is typically caused by a mismatch between the availability of funds and the administrative or bureaucratic capacity to plan, manage, and execute projects effectively. Funds may be available but allocated to lower-priority areas or inefficient uses, rather than high-return investments in infrastructure, health, or education, leading to an overall underutilization of financial resources for key developmental goals. The result of this paradox is often a failure to achieve desired objectives, particularly in underdeveloped regions or sectors like education technology, where crucial investments are stalled despite available funds. In essence, the paradox reveals that financial capacity alone is not enough; effective governance, strong institutional frameworks, and sufficient human capital with the necessary technical literacy are critical to translate financial resources into tangible development outcomes. Furthermore, strong accountability mechanisms serve to guide the optimal utilization of the programmed budget. This balances or limits the discretionary power of the Local Chief Executive, thereby reducing risks of incentivizing an environment for the misallocation and improper use of funds.
