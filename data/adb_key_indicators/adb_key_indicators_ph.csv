The estimates for January 2016 were derived using 2000 census-based population projections. Starting with the April 2016 LFS round, the population projection based on the 2010 CPH was adopted to generate labor force statistics. For 2019 onward, annual estimates adopted the 2015 CPH population projections. Starting 2021, the LFS was conducted monthly.
