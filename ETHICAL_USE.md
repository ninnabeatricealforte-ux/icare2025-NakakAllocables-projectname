# ETHICAL USE POLICY



## 1. What You Must NOT Do

- Do not make defamatory claims about specific individuals, contractors, or politicians.  
- Do not infer corruption where the data does not conclusively show it.  
- Do not identify private persons.  



## 2. Acceptable Practices

Use the data to identify:

- Governance risks  
- Systemic weaknesses  
- Policy gaps  
- Institutional patterns  

Frame your findings as **structural**, not personal.



## 3. Data Privacy

No personal identifying information (PII) is included.  
All political actors named (incumbents, candidates) are **public officials**.



## 4. Transparency in Methods

You must clearly describe:

- Data cleaning steps  
- Assumptions  
- Limitations  
- Sources  

This ensures integrity and replicability.
